      <h2>üìå Introduction</h2>
      <p>Between 2020 and 2024, the film industry underwent remarkable transformations ‚Äî shaped by global events, streaming dominance, and evolving viewer preferences. In this project, we analyzed the <strong>375 most-rated films</strong> from each year to uncover emerging trends and patterns in mainstream cinema.</p>

      <p>Our analysis explores:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>üìä Which <strong>genres</strong> dominated and how genre diversity shifted</li>
        <li>‚≠ê How <strong>ratings</strong> varied across genres and time</li>
        <li>üîÅ The relationship between <strong>popularity</strong> (votes) and <strong>perceived quality</strong> (ratings)</li>
        <li>üíé And perhaps most intriguingly ‚Äî the <strong>hidden gems</strong>: highly rated but lesser-known films that deserve more attention</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Using visualizations and data summaries, this site provides a clear, data-driven look at how popular movies evolved in the early 2020s ‚Äî and what that says about audience tastes, industry output, and overlooked cinematic brilliance.</p>

    <div id="genres" class="section">
      <h2>1. Most Frequently Appearing Genres</h2>
      <p>By tallying each genre's frequency across 375 films, we found that <strong>Drama</strong> and <strong>Action</strong> consistently dominate mainstream releases. This highlights the industry's preference for emotionally driven narratives and high-stakes storytelling.</p>

    </div>

    <div id="diversity" class="section">
      <h2>2. Genre Diversity Over Time</h2>
      <p>We analyzed how many <strong>unique genres</strong> appeared each year. Surprisingly, genre diversity <em>declined</em> from 2020 to 2024, suggesting that the top movies became less varied in style and content.</p>

    <div id="ratings" class="section">
      <h2>3. Rating Distribution by Genre</h2>
      <p>This boxplot shows how viewer ratings differ by genre. While genres like <strong>Documentary</strong> tend to score high, others like <strong>Horror</strong> show mixed responses, reflecting polarizing content and niche appeal.</p>

    <div id="votes" class="section">
      <h2>4. Relationship Between Rating and Vote Count</h2>
      <p>Is popularity linked to quality? We explored the correlation between <strong>average ratings</strong> and <strong>vote counts</strong>. Results suggest no clear linear relationship ‚Äî some highly rated films received few votes, while popular movies didn‚Äôt always score well.</p>

    <div id="gems" class="section">
      <h2>5. Hidden Gems</h2>
      <p>These are the <strong>top-rated yet under-voted</strong> films ‚Äî the hidden gems of the 2020s. Though overlooked by the masses, they received strong praise from those who saw them. A few examples include <em>[Movie A]</em>, <em>[Movie B]</em>, and <em>[Movie C]</em>.</p>
