      <h2>üìå Introduction</h2>
      <p>In this project, I explored the 375 most-rated movies from each year between 2020 and 2024, aiming to understand what shaped mainstream cinema in these years.</p>
  
      <p>Here‚Äôs how I collected and processed the data: using public movie information from TMDb, I gathered details on ratings, genres, votes, and release years, then cleaned and organized the data for analysis.</p>
  
      <p>This page presents three key insights:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>üìä Which genres dominated and how genre diversity changed over time</li>
        <li>‚≠ê How average ratings varied by genre</li>
        <li>üîÅ The link between popularity (vote counts) and perceived quality (ratings)</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>The charts attempt to give a clear, concise view of movie trends and audience preferences in the early 2020s.</p>

      <div id="genres" class="section">
      <h2>1. Most Frequently Appearing Genres</h2>
      <p>
        By tallying each genre's frequency across 375 films, we found that <strong>Action</strong> and <strong>Adventure</strong> movies appeared most often among the top-rated films each year. This suggests these genres are especially popular with audiences. However, it's also possible that more action and adventure movies are simply produced overall, increasing their chances of ranking highly. So while they dominate the charts, this may reflect both  <strong>audience preference</strong> and <strong>industry production</strong> trends.

    <div id="diversity" class="section">
      <h2>2. Genre Diversity Over Time</h2>
      <p>We analyzed how many <strong>unique genres</strong> appeared each year. Surprisingly, genre diversity <em>declined</em> from 2020 to 2024 from 18 unique genre appearing in top 75 in 2020 vs 15 in 2024, suggesting that the top movies became less varied in style and content.</p>

    <div id="ratings" class="section">
      <h2>3. Rating Distribution by Genre</h2>
      <p>This plot shows how viewer ratings differ by genre.Genres like <strong>Animation </strong> tend to score high, others like <strong>Horror </strong> and <strong>Mystery </strong>show lower overall rating.</p>

    <div id="votes" class="section">
      <h2>4. Relationship Between Rating and Vote Count</h2>
      <p>
        Does popularity reflect quality? Our analysis shows a positive trend: movies with more votes generally have higher average ratings. This suggests that good movies tend to attract larger audiences and more reviews.

        <div id="gems" class="section">
      <h2>5. Hidden Gems</h2>
      <p>These are the <strong>top-rated yet under-voted</strong> films ‚Äî the hidden gems of the 2020s. Though overlooked by the masses, they received strong praise from those who saw them. A few examples include <em>Gabriel's Inferno: Part II	</em>, and <em>Life in a Year	</em>.</p>
