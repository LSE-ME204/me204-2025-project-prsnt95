  <h1>ðŸŽ¬ Movie Trends Analysis (2020â€“2024)</h1>
  <p>This project explores trends in popular movies from 2020 to 2024 using data from the most-rated films each year. The analysis focuses on genre diversity, rating patterns, and vote behavior to uncover interesting insights and hidden gems.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>1. Most Frequently Appearing Genres</h2>
    <p>We counted how often each genre appeared across all 375 movies. This gives a sense of which genres dominated mainstream cinema. Genres like <strong>Drama</strong> and <strong>Action</strong> appeared the most frequently.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>2. Genre Diversity Over Time</h2>
    <p>To measure how diverse the genre landscape was, we counted the number of <strong>unique genres per year</strong>. The result shows a <strong>decreasing trend</strong> in genre diversity â€” meaning fewer different genres are represented in top movies over time.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>3. Rating Distribution by Genre</h2>
    <p>Using a boxplot, we examined how <strong>average ratings vary by genre</strong>. Some genres consistently receive higher ratings than others, and some show wide variation in quality. This highlights genre-based viewer preferences and content quality trends.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>4. Relationship Between Rating and Vote Count</h2>
    <p>We analyzed the correlation between <strong>vote average</strong> and <strong>vote count</strong> across all movies. A line plot and boxplot helped us explore whether movies with more votes tend to receive higher ratings. The results suggest a complex, nonlinear relationship.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>5. Hidden Gems</h2>
    <p>We filtered for <strong>highly rated but lesser-voted</strong> movies to find hidden gems â€” movies that were well-reviewed but didnâ€™t receive widespread attention. These could be great recommendations for curious viewers looking for quality content off the radar.</p>
